This project is to predict the likelihood of diabetes at early stage. The dataset and its associated description can be found here. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.

Sixteen features are available in the dataset, but only eleven of them have been picked to train the model. The model has been constructed with the algorithm of Support Vector Classifier. The score of its performance measured by 'f1' could go as high as 0.98.
